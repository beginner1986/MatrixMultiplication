# MatrixMultiplication
Matrix multiplication in C++ using Open MP.

The purpose of this programe is to check OpenMP effectiveness when different loops are parallelized.

Test data should be generated by matrix generator: https://github.com/beginner1986/MatrixGenerator

Results correctness for parallel computation should be checked by comparing it to sequential results by using: https://github.com/beginner1986/MatrixCompare
